# object-tracking-with-opencv-and-python
 
This tutorial focuses on Object Tracking with Opencv and Python. Object tracking differs from object detection, as it tracks an object's movement frame-by-frame, keeping a record of its location over time. On the other hand, object detection detects the object in every single frame. We will begin by discussing object detection, followed by how object tracking can be applied to it.
